Technologies Used:

Frontend-> JSP (JavaServer Pages), CSS
Backend-> Java
Database Connectivity-> JDBC
Database-> MySQL
Frameworks & IDE-> Servlets API, Eclipse EE
Database Tools-> JDBC, MySQL Workbench

Project Overview:
Developed a robust To-Do Web Application designed to enhance productivity and task management. The application offers a user-friendly interface for managing tasks efficiently, with the ability to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and mark tasks as completed.

Key Features:

Task Management-> Users can add tasks with specific due dates via the frontend interface.

CRUD Operations-> Users can create new tasks, update existing tasks, and delete tasks as needed.

Task Display-> All tasks are dynamically displayed and updated, reflecting changes in real-time.

Mark as Completed-> Tasks can be marked as completed, which automatically moves them to a separate 'Completed Tasks' table with an automatic timestamp indicating the completion date.
Completed Tasks Management-> Users have the option to delete tasks from the completed tasks list as well.

Technical Implementation:

Frontend-> The user interface was developed using JSP and CSS, ensuring a responsive and interactive experience for users.
Backend-> Java was used to handle business logic, with Servlets managing the HTTP requests and responses.
Database-> MySQL served as the database management system, with JDBC facilitating communication between the Java application and the database.
Development Environment-> Eclipse EE was utilized for development, and MySQL Workbench was employed for database design and management.

This project demonstrates my ability to develop full-stack web applications, showcasing skills in both frontend and backend technologies, as well as database management. Through this project, I have honed my skills in Java, JSP, Servlets, and MySQL, and gained valuable experience in creating efficient and user-friendly web applications.Technologies Used: Frontend-> JSP (JavaServer Pages), CSS Backend-> Java Database Connectivity-> JDBC Database-> MySQL Frameworks & IDE-> Servlets API, Eclipse EE Database Tools-> JDBC, MySQL Workbench Project Overview: Developed a robust To-Do Web Application designed to enhance productivity and task management.
